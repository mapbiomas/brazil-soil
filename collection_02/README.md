# MapBiomas Soil Collection 2

## Description
Collection 2 focuses on mapping soil organic carbon stocks, particle size distribution, and texture across Brazil. This collection builds upon the initial methods and data used in the beta collection, incorporating improvements and additional data sources to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the soil property maps.

For detailed information about the data and modeling approach, please refer to the MapBiomas Soil [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/metodo-mapbiomas-solo/).

## Objectives
