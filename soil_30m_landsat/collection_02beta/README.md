# MapBiomas Soil Collection 2 Beta

## Description
This directory contains scripts for modeling soil organic carbon stocks, particle size distribution, and texture across Brazil as part of the MapBiomas Soil project.

## Subdirectories
This directory contains the following subdirectories:

* [carbon](./carbon/): Contains scripts for modeling soil organic carbon stocks in space and time.
* [texture](./texture/): Contains scripts for modeling soil particle size distribution (clay, silt, and sand) and texture in space and depth.
* [covariate](./covariate/): Contains scripts for generating covariates used in the soil modeling process.

## Usage
The code in this repository is designed to be run on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Code Editor. Follow these steps to use the code:

1. **Create a Google Earth Engine Account**:
   * If you don't have an account, [create one here](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/).

2. **Access the GEE Code Editor**:

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   * Clone this repository to your local workspace:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-soil.git
     ```
   * Navigate to the `collection_02beta` directory:
     ```sh
     cd brazil-soil/soil_30m_landsat/collection_02beta
     ```

4. **Open the Scripts in GEE**:
   * Open the GEE Code Editor and create a new script.
   * Copy the contents of the desired script from the `carbon`, `texture`, or `covariate` subdirectory into the GEE Code Editor.

5. **Run the Script**:
   * Follow the instructions provided in the script to run it and generate the desired maps.

6. **Adjust Parameters**:
   * If needed, adjust the parameters in the script to fit your specific requirements, including the relevant paths.
